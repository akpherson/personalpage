				<h2>About</h2> 
				<section id="about"> 				
				<hr>
				<p>
					I attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and graduated with a focus in visual communications, while also keeping up with painting. <br>
					After spending years creating (traditional and digital) works of art, I felt a need to separate my work and my passion to some degree. <br>
					Front end development allows the perfect amount of creativity while also providing the structure I need in order to evolve. I am excited to begin
					this journey and meet like minded individuals along the way! Feel free to contact me if you're looking for a study buddy or are just a like minded indvidual looking to collaborate.
