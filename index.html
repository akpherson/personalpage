					<h3>About</h3> 				
				<hr>
				<p>
					I attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and graduated with a focus in visual communications, while also keeping up with painting.
After spending years creating (traditional and digital) works of art, I felt a need to separate my work and my passion to some degree.
Front-end development allows the perfect amount of creativity while also providing the structure I need to evolve. I am excited to begin this journey and meet 
like-minded individuals along the way! Feel free to contact me if you're looking for a study buddy or are just looking to collaborate.
