# My Personal Page

**Description**\
This is a personal website using HTML and CSS. The cool tone colors were chosen to match the image of the fish tank and the warm hue is meant to break that color up.\

**Hiccups**\
A few hiccups were simple things like trying to get the bullet points in the ul to remain next to the text, when it was spanning out. This overstack question helped me solve the issue [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28977320/how-do-i-get-the-bullet-points-of-a-ul-to-center-with-the-text/28977358].\

There is a lot I have to learn and woud like to clean up in the future. The LinkedIn link is currently blank as I do not yet have a LinkedIn account.
